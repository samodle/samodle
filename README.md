### Hi, I'm Sam 👋🚲💻🚀

<img src="https://github.com/samodle/samodle/blob/master/0.jfif" alt="Sam Odle has ideas.">
I'm a tech leader and engineer who is passionate about the future of work. Some technologies I enjoy working with include .NET (especially C#), Swift, MongoDB, a little python, and - very recenctly - Angular. I co-founded <a href="www.forkcareers.com">Fork</a>, a venture currently incubating out of <a href="https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/current-team/forkcareers/">Harvard's Innovation Lab</a>, where we leverage AI to reveal career pathways to optimize the placement and growth of talent in the jobs of tomorrow.
